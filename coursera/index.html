        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents
         designed to be displayed in a web browser.
        HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included 
        cues for the appearance of the document.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the 
        presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a 
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World 
        Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
        ations. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all 
        major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
